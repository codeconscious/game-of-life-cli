# Overview

After reading the first part of [a blog post about Reddit interviews](https://alexgolec.dev/reddit-interview-problems-the-game-of-life/) by Alex Golec, I felt that creating my own iteration of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in C# might be a fun exercise. Other than verifying the rules, I opted not to reference other implementations.

This console project targets the latest .NET 6 preview version and uses some still-unreleased features in C# 10 that I simply wanted to use.

TODO:
- Add and edit application settings
- Allow submitting seeds manually (maybe)
- Check the possibility of higher resolution
